<p>I'm kicking around <a href="http://drupal.org/project/colourise">the Colourise theme</a> for the next release (6.x-2.x). It's not just bug fix or more features but definitely radical change in code. <a href="http://960.gs/">The 960GS framework</a> was removed from layout due to I need to add flexible page width for the theme (5 width levels plus fluid layout). But anyway, <a href="http://sonspring.com/">Nathan Smith</a>'s CSS framework always inspires me (and anyone) to create our own framework somehow.</p>
<p>For the new layout of Colourise theme, I got some idea and code sample from <a href="http://drupal.org/project/basic">the Basic theme</a> for Drupal. In my boo-boo opinion, this is not much as complicated as <a href="http://drupal.org/project/zen">Zen theme</a> or <a href="http://drupal.org/project/genesis">Genesis theme</a>. It's a starter theme that stripped down version of the ZEN theme and help me a lot for working around a Drupal theme quickly and simply. (The live site evidence is there : <a href="http://teacherooh.com/">TeacherOoh.com</a>.)</p>
<p>And another classic resource for me is <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/holygrail">Matthew Levine's Holy Grail</a>. This article was published on <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">AlistApart</a> 3 years ago but still useful for anyone who searching for <a href="http://positioniseverything.net/articles/onetruelayout/">One True Layout</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I'm mixing and cooking them all together in the new Colourise theme.</strong></p>
<p>Hope this theme will be some more delicious, soon.</p>
