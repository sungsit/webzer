<p>When it comes,<br>
When you have no one to adore,<br>
You'll be the king of your own spirit.<br>
Don't blame anyone else, just your own stupid.</p>
<p>Alienated strangeness,<br>
I smell some changes.<br>
Here we're gonna kill each other cruelly,<br>
Not the civil war of ideology<br>
But serving one's greedy authority.</p>
<p>I wanna be the man on the Moon?<br>
There is no God there, Mr.Fortune.<br>
And here on Earth has no peaceful room.<br>
We need no hegemony, for our full spirit with no gloom.</p>
<p><strong>No Color No Blind.</strong><br><strong>Paint Your Own Spirit!</strong></p>

<p>Say <em>I don't love my country</em>, but though I don't want to see anyone here and there suffering or dead. For me as a former political researcher, Thai politics is always too boring to participate. Those dominant actors (from any institutes or movements) seem to lack of creativity. At least since the cruel "October 6, 1976", as soon as they know their enemy, they will raise the old same monarchical issue to hit the opposite. We keep crawling on the same track around 30 years!</p>
<p>Not only political and economic troubles emerged here, but also <strong>Thai individuals are facing the Spiritual Crisis.</strong> They're hearing without listening and keep speaking without talking to each other. <em>So we have no clue for the future of our motherland.</em> In my opinion, currently Thailand is not yet in the real ideology battle. But sooner or later, "That Day" must come to rearrange everything... radically. (I inevitably believe that soon "the Godfather" may be disappeared or symbolized as powerless traditional institute then the new State will be incarnated.) Sorry, I suspect that's true, just wish we can get through that situation with less violence but more rationality. Anyway, the answer is still blowing in the wind...</p>
<p>Should we have to build our new political system from scratch? Or we just need to improve that old pseudo-democracy apart from (elitism's) technocracy? (Hey... don't say that all we need is the new law or constitution or even coup, 'cos formal institutions are too rigid to solve the new complicated conflicts. No more obsolete point-of-view.)</p>
<p>Say we now need Democracy 2.0! At least, we all should try to participate and listen to each other before releasing the BETA version of our new politics. That's my innocent imagination 'cos <strong>the main question</strong>, as individualist, is...</p>
<p><strong>How could we widen out our mind to hold many different opinions?</strong></p>
<p>We've been separated by too much visible and invisible powers. The temporal issues make us hate each other not in person but by <em>color</em>. That's suck! I don't want to hate any color 'cos <strong>we can use the old to mix the new up (infinite ways) and we exactly have the right to choose no color, too. Let's paint your own spirit with no color!</strong></p>
