<p>
A week ago I found an awesome theme from <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/strange-little-town">wordpress.org</a> and I can't resist to do something about it. But you know, I'm a Drupal user who doesn't want to migrate his own experiences to another platform. So I asked the theme author, <a href="http://magical.nu/about/">Minmin</a> from <a href="http://magical.nu/2008/12/wp-theme-strange-little-house/">magical.nu</a> for her permission, and now I'm porting "Strange Little Town", a lovely whimsical WordPress theme, to Drupal.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_Y0CVoTNHnqo/SZMWH3GKBmI/AAAAAAAAASA/ZM5vGEmWHpI/s400/screenshot.png" alt="Strang Little Town Screenshot"></p>
<p>
<strong>Yes, Minmin gave me a kindly permission to contribute "Strange Little Town" for all Drupal users.</strong></p>

I don't know much about her but the theme itself will explicitly tell anyone about her design skill. I never love purple or pink before I meet this theme but the whimsical, glassy look and feel instantly changed my mind.</p>
<p>
The code transferring is in progress. I have already created the theme project page at drupal.org : <a href="http://drupal.org/project/strange_little_town">http://drupal.org/project/strang...</a>. The dev. version will be available soon (maybe next weekend). For testing right now, if you need to get my latest files, you can go to <a href="http://cvs.drupal.org/viewvc.py/drupal/contributions/themes/strange_little_town/?hideattic=1&amp;pathrev=DRUPAL-6--1">Drupal CVS Repositories</a> to download them all. Again, for testing only!</p>
<p><strong>Edit :</strong> The Development Snapshot was already released. <br>Download here, <a href="http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/strange_little_town-6.x-1.x-dev.tar.gz">strange_little_town-6.x-1.x-dev.tar.gz</a>
