title: Drupal "Strange Little Town" first beta

<p>
Far from perfect (well I'm not perfectionist anyway), all I really need is some feedback from Drupal users, especially from Right-To-Left people. This Beta release was only tested in Mac OS environment (10.5.6) with FireFox 3.0.6 and Safari 3.2.1 (but seems Opera doesn't like it, I have to find out some more).
</p>
<p>
For our (least) beloved IE family, I can't afford to use native Windows. But the magic application like <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> has saved my life so I can install XP to use <a href="http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE">MultipleIE</a> to check those silly bugs. And more than I expected, the theme works fine in IE8 RC1. But you know, <strong>bug is all around!</strong> (especially in IE6/7).

And I hope the stable release will be coming soon. I'm waiting for <a href="http://twitter.com/magically">@magically</a>'s original artwork for converting .PNG to .GIF files to fix IE6 transparent PNG bug. But her laptop was failed so the files are everywhere. Fortunately, she just got a brand new desktop so it wouldn't be so long to get through our mission.

Thanks again <a href="http://magical.nu/">Minmin</a> ;)
