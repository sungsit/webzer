<p>This site's being DEcOnsTrUCteD. Could you please leave ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>design</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... alone?</p>
<p>I keep on debugging my messy source , compiling my fussy thought and kicking around my messy fussy workspace (it's been my bedroom already). I don't mind (and don't want) your sexiest underwear, so you'll see this plain naked site till the day (maybe night) I finish dressing up my mind (or forever).</p>
<p>Um... actually, it's not quite as complicated (or freak) as it sounds and I'm not any kind of geek anyway. I just want to throw away my subconscious Disorder then utilize some fruitful and faithful Disciplines and Do RECONSTRUCT anything inside my head and my bedroom. I hope so. (Oh Gibbo! don't forget to REDESIGN this site too.)</p>
<p>In the mean time, there may be some broken links on this site. But I won't apologize for the situation you couldn't find what you expect to see. Just don't blame yourself too, it's my boo-boo you know. And as soon as you forgive me, please do the ... <a class="super-size" href="search">SEARCH</a> or (if you want to) read <a class="super-size" href="blog">My BLOG</a> (almost in Thai).</p>
