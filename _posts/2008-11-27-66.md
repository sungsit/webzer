<strong>Apparently Thailand is dead now!</strong><br>
They kissed then tore her apart.<br>
I don't know why, they're calling for <strong>Democracy</strong><br>
while they've been <strong>Demo who Crazy</strong> ... ego loaded.

drive away and its the same<br>
everywhere death row, everyone's a victim<br>
your joys are counterfeit<br>
this happiness corrupt political shit</p>
<p>living life like a comatose<br>
ego loaded and swallow, swallow, swallow</p>
<p>under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness<br>
under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness<br>
under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness<br>
under neon loneliness everlasting nothingness</p>
<p>all we want from you are the kicks you've given us<br>
all we want from you are the kicks you've given us<br>
all we want from you are the kicks you've given us<br><strong>All we want from you are the kicks you've given us</strong>
