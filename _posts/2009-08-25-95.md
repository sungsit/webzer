<p>Finally, I can launch my new demo sites for Drupal contrib. themes after a long period of idleness.</p>
<p><strong>Let's visit <a href="http://studio.webzer.net/">my studio</a></strong> or go to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://studio.webzer.net/drupal/beach/">Beach</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://studio.webzer.net/drupal/colourise/">Colourise</a> and <a href="http://studio.webzer.net/drupal/strange.little.town/">Strange Little Town</a>.</p>
<p>All these demo sites are on the same code base (with symlinks) and same database (find it out there: <a href="http://justinhileman.info/articles/a-more-secure-drupal-multisite-install">a more secure drupal [multisite] install</a>). But each site still need their own caches and variable settings (<code>$db_prefix</code> array) because they're using different themes. That's one of Drupal's magic which helpful for launching multi-sites with less resource and time consuming (but my laziness is a big burden!).</p>
<p>Webzer.net and my Drupal demo was currently hosted by <a href="http://www.webfaction.com?affiliate=sungsit" title="Go to webfaction.com">WebFaction</a> which reliable and full of new tools (and toys) for curious web learners (like me) such as Rails, Django, SVN and other open source software installers (of course, you can find Drupal and other popular CMS too).</p>
<p>Yeah... you can tell them <strong><a href="http://www.webfaction.com?affiliate=sungsit" title="That's me and my referrer link!">Sungsit</a> loves their service.</strong></p>
