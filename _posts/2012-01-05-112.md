<p>My king is american-born so he has american citizenship and freedom of speech? Ironically, unlike me and you and may be the rest of the world, he and his family can not be criticized anywhere, huh?</p>
<p>Could I say that I love him as a grandfather not God(father)? I have no reason to hate him, thank God I'm atheist! A far as I know, there's no law against saying thing that way, right? He is surely human like us unless you believe that Thailand is another special planet existing in the world, hopefully not.</p>
<p>Monarchism is just "man-made" political mechanism. Nothing in the world can not be criticized and critical thinking is no way like (that easy) insulting.</p>
<p>Respectful but never fearful. เคารพแต่อย่าหวั่นกลัว</p>
